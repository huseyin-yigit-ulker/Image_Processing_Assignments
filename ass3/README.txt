RESULT DATA FÄ°LE EXPLAIN:

The names of the images in the result data folder mean:
"source" pattern : the image we will use as the background, the number next to it indicates the image index. eg "source11"

"target" pattern :we got some part of image, the number next to it indicates the image index. eg "target11"

"output" pattern refers to the result images. The first number next to it represents the image index, the other
number represents the pyramid level.Such as:
"output11_3levels.jpg" is the result of 11th indexed target and source images, "3levels" is pyramid level 3.
"output11_7levels.jpg" is the result of 11th indexed target and source images, "7levels" is pyramid level 7.
"output11_10levels.jpg" is the result of 11th indexed target and source images, "10levels" is pyramid level 10


*For the code to work, the images (source and target) must be in the same directory as the code.
