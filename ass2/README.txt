The AIN432_Ass2.ipynb file contains the code for the model.

The report.pdf file is the report in which I explain the model and color transfer in detail.

The "photos" folder contains the expected result image,
its histogram distribution, the result image I found and
its histogram pixel distribution data.
Example view:
expected_img0.png ---> expected image
expected0.png ---> pixel histogram distribution of expected picture
result0.jpg ---> image produced by the model for part 1
result0.png ---> pixel histogram distribution of the image produced by the model
result_part2_1.jpg --->image produced by the model for part 2

Note:If you want to run the code, run it in the directory where the data images are.
