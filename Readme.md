# Image Processing Assignments Repository Readme

This repository contains a collection of assignments related to image processing. Each assignment focuses on different aspects of image processing techniques and algorithms. Below is a brief overview of the contents of this repository.

## Assignments

**Assignment 1: Image Combining**
    - Description:
        The purpose of this assignment is to view the images of an image in different colour spaces, to obtain a colorful and high quality image by combining it with image processing techniques.


            1- The process of reading images from the data set

            2- Destroying the black and white areas on the edges of the read images

            3- Separating the images from the horizontal black areas in the picture that separate the channels from each other

            4- Common region scanning to merge images of different sizes that I separated as B, G, R

            5- Image enhancement processes

**Assignment 2: Color Transfer**

    - Description:

        In this assignment, we will
        use the source image, which is our original image for color transfer, and the target

        image, which contains the colors that we will transfer to our source image,
        as data in our assignment. To apply the color transfer, I will use 2 different
        methods, which I will explain in more detail in the subsections. These methods:

        1- Using the ℓαβ color space and statistical calculations
        2- Similar region detection between target and source images

3. **Assignment 3: Image Blending**

- Description:

    In this assignment, image blending was applied using Laplacian and Gaussian
pyramids.

4. **Image Classification Using Cross Correlation**
   - Description: This assignment focuses on image classification using the cross-correlation technique. Cross-correlation is a method used to measure the similarity between two signals or images. In the context of image classification, cross-correlation can be used to compare an input image with a set of predefined template images.
