While running the code, keep your data in a folder named "data" and run it 
by opening "edit", "result" and "result_sharp folders. "edit" folder holds the 
B, G, R versions of the pictures, "result" folder holds the merged image before 
the image enhancement state, " result_sharp" folder holds the images after image 
enhancement process. The program will save the results with the folder.
